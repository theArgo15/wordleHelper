Wordle is a neat game! I want to explore solving it programmatically 

My first attempt of this solver will take a .txt file of the words.
Originally used a general english dictionary, but I have moved to a Scrabble dictionary
I started with the incorrect assumption that Wordle would not use a word with repeating letters
My function that ranks words does not work well with a library that includes repeating letters
Will need to implement a new algorithm.
